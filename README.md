# Connect Four - Distance Learning Centre JavaScript Lesson 9 Assignment

## About The Project

This project was built from scratch and is a development of the classic Connect 4 game. The game is for two players. The object is to build a line of four adjacent discs either horizonally, vertically or diagonally. The player who achieves the line of four first is the winner. The players take it in turns to place their discs by "dropping" them into the columns. The "drop" is activated by clicking on the slot at the top of the chosen column (or anywhere on the column itself)

My own personal stretch goal was to achieve total scalability in the code. In this way the players choose the board size and the number of adjacent discs required to win. Thus, they can play a game of Connect 3, Connect 4 etc up to Connect 7!

JavaScript skills used include:

- Modular JavaScript
- Nested for-loops
- Dynamic rendering of html to update game status after each player's turn
- Array methods forEach() and findLast()
- Updating styles dynamically, including grid properties
- Separation of concerns, with larger functions broken up into smaller ones where appropriate.
- Arrow functions for callbacks
- Event listeners and the event argument
- Data attributes
- The ternary operator
- Template literals
- Devising the logic to check systematically for a winning line and to check whether a "stack" is full.

The game is designed to be played on a computer screen. It is not designed to be responsive and is not suitable for mobile phones.
